# signalk-modbus-serial-plugin

This project aims to be a SignalK server plugin for reading Modbus serial data.
It owns a lot to (well, it is almost a verbatim copy of)
[signalk-modbus-plugin](https://github.com/codekilo/signalk-modbus-plugin)
which implements similar interface for Modbus TCP devices.

The project is work-in-progress.
